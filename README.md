# Times Series Analysis of Weather Data

Here I experiment with some time series analysis methods on weather data from a friend's at home weather station in Berlin.

The sources I reference for the methods are:
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting/
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/


Goal:

Jupyter Notebook of historical data with prediciton methods (up to 2025)

Python file to collect data from website and put into csv files

data directory holding relevant data

Online processing? (eventually -> continually update data directory in batches)
